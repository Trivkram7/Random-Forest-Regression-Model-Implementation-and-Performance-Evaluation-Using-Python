Random Forest Regression
About This Project

In this project, I built a Random Forest Regression model using Python and Scikit-Learn. The goal is to train the model on a dataset and evaluate how well it predicts the target variable.

What This Project Does

Loads the dataset using pandas

Selects numerical features for training

Splits the data into training and testing sets

Trains a Random Forest Regressor

Evaluates performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² score

Visualizes Actual vs Predicted results

Tools Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
